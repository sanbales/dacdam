The Data-Farmable Agent-based Cyber Defense Assessment Model (DACDAM) allows
researchers to analyze high-level cyber defense what if questions.

The model maps cyber technical concepts (e.g., vulnerabilities, patches, routers)
to operational concepts (e.g., 'Movement to Contact', 'Area Defence') in order
study the impact of cyber-centric alternatives to operational capabilities.
